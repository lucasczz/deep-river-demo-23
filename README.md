# Opportunities and Challenges for Online Deep Learning

This repository contains the code to follow along with the hands-on-tutorial on opportunities and challenges for online deep learning, held at ECML PKDD 2023. 

To run the provided code, we suggest creating a new Python environment using e.g. Anaconda or venv. 

To do so, first navigate to the demo's directory in your terminal.

### Anaconda

1. When using Anaconda run
  
        conda env create --file env.yml

2. Once the installation has finished activate your environment with

        conda activate deep-river-demo

### Venv

1. When using venv run 

        python3 -m venv deep-river-demo

2. Activate the enviroment on Mac/Linux using 

        source deep-river-demo/bin/activate

    or on Windows

        deep-river-demo/Scripts/activate

3. Install the requirements by running
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt


Now open the first Jupyter Notebook file using

    jupyter lab notebooks/overview.ipynb

and follow along the tutorial!
